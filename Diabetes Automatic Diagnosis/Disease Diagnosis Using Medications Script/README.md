# Disease Diagnosis (Medications) Script
### Author: Ahad Zai
## Functionality
This script is created for the diabetes project. The main purpose of the script is to read through each patient's medicine history contained in a text file and then using a set of medications for diabetes as keywords, assign a diagnosis to each file. The diagnosis of 'YES' will be given to patients that take diabetic medications and 'NO' to those who don't. The program then generates an excel file containing each patient and their respective diagnosis along with a log file containing the keywords that were matched.
## Instructions
1) Add the text files to the 'patient_files' directory
2) Download the python script and run it
3) A new excel file will be generated along with a log file
