# Disease Diagnosis Automation
This repository contains all of the required scripts and instructions to automate the diagnosis of three diseases (Diabetes, Gingivitis, Periodontitis) using electronic dental data. Other scripts used to analyze, clean and manipulate the data are also present.
This was a project for my summer 2019 internship as a Software Engineer at the Indiana University-Purdue University: School of Dentistry.
