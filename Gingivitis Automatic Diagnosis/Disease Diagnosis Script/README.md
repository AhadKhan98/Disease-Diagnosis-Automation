# Disease Diagnosis Script
### Author: Ahad Zai
## Functionality
This script is created for the gingivitis project. The script reads all patient text files contained in the working directory and creates 4 folders (No_Gingivitis, Localized_Gingivitis, Generalized_Gingivitis, Unknown) where each file goes through a criteria of checks and gets put in the folder based on the diagnosis.
## Instructions
1) Make sure all the text files are in the same directory as the script.
2) Download and run the script.
3) Once completed, check directory for the new folders.
