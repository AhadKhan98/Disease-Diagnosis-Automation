# Unknowns Reducer Script
### Author: Ahad Zai
## Functionality
This script is created for the gingivitis project. We found out that some of the patients had missing 'ATTACH' information. The patients had their 'ATTACH' reported in data used for the periodontitis project. The purpose of this script is to add the missing information to the text files contained in the directory from text files containing the complete data (Stored in /Knowns Directory)
## Instructions
1) Make sure all the incomplete text files are in the same directory as the script.
2) Copy all the complete text files from the periodontitis project to the /Knowns folder
3) Download and run the script.
4) The incomplete text files will now have complete information.
