# eHost XML Keywords Collector
### Author: Ahad Zai
## Functionality
This script is used to collect keywords generated by manually annotating 100 patients' clinical diagnosis for diabetes in eHost. eHost generates multiple XML files that contain the highlighted keywords. This script extracts those keywords and creates a new text file containing only the keywords.
## Instructions
1) Place all XML files generated by eHost in the working directory.
2) Download and run the script.
3) A new file 'keywords.txt' will be created containing all collected keywords.
