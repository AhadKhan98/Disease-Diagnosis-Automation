# Merge TXT Files Script
### Author: Ahad Zai
## Functionality
This script was developed for merging medical history data from multiple EagleSoft practices. This script is used to merge multiple text files into one single master text file.
## Instructions
1) Add the text files to the working directory
2) Download the python script and run it
3) Two new text files (master_file.txt) and (log.txt) will be created. 
**NOTE:** The log.txt will display the number of lines copied from each text file. The total number might be one less than the original as the script does not include the header row.
